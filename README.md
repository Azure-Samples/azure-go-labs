# Azure Samples Lab for Go

A collection of labs demonstrating how to develop applications with Go, Visual Studio Code, the Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL) 2 and Azure.

## Build and Containerize a Go application

In this lab we will build a sample Go web application locally as a binary. We will then build the Go application in the cloud using Azure Container Registry (ACR) Build and Docker's multi-stage build capabilities.

## Containerize a Go application using Visual Studio Code and the Docker extension

Create, build and run a container for a Go application using the Docker extension for Visual Studio Code to generate Dockerfiles. This lab also shows the Docker extension's support for the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2.

## Open Source Development with the Windows Terminal (Preview) and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2

This project walks you through setting up and customizing a Windows PC for Open Source development. We'll introduce you to the Windows Terminal and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2. At the end of this lab you will use VS Code to debug an application running in WSL.

## Use Hyperscale (Citus) to speed up analytics

This lab is an introduction to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale (Citus). First, you will create a cluster to scale out PostgreSQL and turn it into a distributed database. Then, you will create a schema and tables, load test data, and create a rollup function to massively speed up your query workload.
